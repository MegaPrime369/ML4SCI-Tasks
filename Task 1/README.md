### 1. Introduction
For this task 1 have trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Resnet-15 model

### 2. Training 
- we split the dataset into train: test with ratio of `80%: 20%`.
- In the model, `optimizer : Adam`, `learning rate : 1e-3`, `batch size : 128`.

### 3. Performance

The model has obtained the highest ROC-AUC of `0.7925 ~ 0.8` on the test set
The ROC Curve is given in `[24]`
